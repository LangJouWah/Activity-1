                The group consists of five members: 
                Sakura, Kim Chae-won, Huh Yun-jin, Kazuha, and Hong Eun-chae. 
                Originally a six-member group, Kim Ga-ram left on July 20, 2022, 
                after the termination of her exclusive contract.<br>

                The phrase represents how the group is 
                "determined to move forward with unswerving fearlessness in the eyes of the world."</p>
